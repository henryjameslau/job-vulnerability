</Standfirst>

<Section>
	<p>
		Jobs most vulnerable to reduced hours or pay during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic had lower average wages compared with other occupations. This may have affected the ability of employees in these jobs to manage financially during lockdown.
	</p>
	<p>
		Although self-employed people are not included in this analysis, a <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/wellbeing/bulletins/personalandeconomicwellbeingintheuk/january2021">recent personal and economic well-being bulletin</a> reported a reduction in their working hours and income, even if they had received support from the Self-Employment Income Support Scheme (SEISS). Data from the Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings (ASHE) used in this analysis do not record any Universal Credit claimed by workers who are furloughed, nor can these data measure the number of people who might have become unemployed during the pandemic.
	</p>
	<p>
		Using previous studies of <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/employmentandemployeetypes/articles/whichjobscanbedonefromhome/2020-07-21">homeworking</a> and <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/earningsandworkinghours/articles/coronavirusandkeyworkersintheuk/2020-05-15">key
			worker</a> status, occupations have been grouped into three categories, based on their ability to work remotely and whether they are classed as an essential or key worker:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li><span class="high">high vulnerability jobs</span>: non-key worker roles that are very unlikely to be done from home</li>
		<li><span class="medium">medium vulnerability jobs</span>: occupations that include some key worker roles, and some jobs that may partially be done from home </li>
		<li><span class="low">low vulnerability jobs</span>: roles very likely be done from home or classed as key worker roles</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
		More than 8 million employees in the UK (32.4%) fall into the <span class="high">high vulnerability</span> group, meaning they may have been more likely to see a reduction in working hours or wages during the pandemic.
	</p>

	<p>
		More than half of employees (53.0%) who were furloughed in April 2020 worked in <span class="high">high vulnerability</span> jobs. Occupations in this group also made up 88% of jobs with a median hourly wage below £9.12, <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/earningsandworkinghours/bulletins/lowandhighpayuk/2020">the threshold for low pay</a>.

	<p>Jobs considered elementary occupations, such as construction labourers, security guards or cleaners, and skilled trades occupations such as electricians, gardeners or tailors fall mostly into the <span class="high">high vulnerability</span> group.</p>
	<p>This means that, as they are less likely to either be classed as key workers or able to work from home, people in these jobs could be more likely to be furloughed or work fewer hours than normal.</p>
	<p>In contrast, most professional occupations, which include healthcare specialists, teachers and accountants, fall into the <span class="low">low vulnerability</span> category.</p>

	<h2>Men are more likely to work in high vulnerability jobs</h2>
	<p>
		Men are more likely than women to work in jobs in the <span class="high">high vulnerability</span> category: two thirds (66.3%) of employees in this group are male. Conversely, women make up more than half of employees in the <span class="medium">medium</span> and <span class="low">low vulnerability</span> groups (55.1% and
		61.7% respectively).</p>

		<h3>Men are more likely than women to work in high vulnerability jobs</h3>

		<p>However, 72.3% of employees in <span class="high">high vulnerability</span> occupations with median hourly wages below the low wage threshold are women. Low paid jobs include cleaning, domestic or kitchen, and catering roles, which are mostly done by women.
		</p>

		<h2>Younger employees are less likely to work in low vulnerability jobs</h2>
		<p>
			There is no age group that is over-represented within the <span class="high">high vulnerability</span> group.
		</p>
		<p>
			However, very few younger employees are in jobs considered <span class="low">low vulnerability</span>. Around a fifth (22.7%) of employees aged 20 to 29 years are in <span class="low">low vulnerability</span> jobs, and this falls to 9.5% of employees aged 16 to 19 years.

	<h2>Method</h2>

	<p>
		Using previous analysis of <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/employmentandemployeetypes/articles/whichjobscanbedonefromhome/2020-07-21">homeworking</a> and <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/earningsandworkinghours/articles/coronavirusandkeyworkersintheuk/2020-05-15">key
  	worker</a> status, we have grouped occupations into three categories based on their ability to work from home and whether they are classed as a key worker.
		</p>
 	<p>
		The <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/employmentandemployeetypes/articles/whichjobscanbedonefromhome/2020-07-21">homeworking</a> analysis estimates the likelihood of being able to work from home for different occupations. Those with the highest likelihood of being able to work from home are rated 0, and those least likely to work from home are rated 4.5.
		</p>
 <p>
	 In this analysis, those rating below 0.7 were assigned to the low vulnerability group. These are the occupations that are most likely to be able to continue working from home. Those least likely to work from home (those rating above 1.5) were assigned a score of 2 to be used in collaboration with the outcome of the key worker scoring. Those rating between 0.7 and 1.5 were assigned a score of 1.
	 </p>

<p>
	The <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/earningsandworkinghours/articles/coronavirusandkeyworkersintheuk/2020-05-15">key
	worker</a> analysis tells us for each industry which occupation is likely to be a key worker. When applying this analysis to the occupations by industry in Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings (ASHE), we can see how many employees in each occupation are likely to be key workers.
	</p>

<p>
	In this analysis, those occupations with a key worker rate of 80% and above were assigned to the low vulnerability group. Those with a key worker rate of less than 50% were assigned a score of 2, to be used in collaboration with the outcome of the key worker scoring. Those scoring between 50% and 80% were assigned a score of 1.
	</p>

<p>
	We combined the home workability and key worker ratings to determine whether the occupation is a high, medium or low vulnerability occupation, with a higher combined score meaning higher vulnerability.
	</p>

<p>This means each group is comprised of:</p>
<ul>
<li>high vulnerability: occupations scoring 4 or above – likely non-key worker roles that are very unlikely to be done from home</li>

<li>medium vulnerability: occupations scoring 2 to 3 – likely non-key worker roles that may partially be done from home</li>

<li>low vulnerability: occupations scoring below 2 – jobs that can very likely be done from home or are likely to be key worker roles</li>
</ul>
